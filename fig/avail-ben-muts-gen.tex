\textbf{Well-mixed and spatially-structured populations exhibit similar relationship between population size and mutator fixation probability.}
\footnotesize
In both scenarios, as available beneficial mutations are increased, mutators gain favor in progressively larger population sizes.
Simulations were conducted on GPU using the counter-based genome model, with populations initialized to a 50/50 mix of non- and mutators.
Subpopulations comprised 256 agents per PE.
Shaded bands show bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals.
