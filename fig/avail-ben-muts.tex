\textbf{Availability of adaptive potential shifts favor from nonmutators to mutators.}
\footnotesize
Area plots show non- vs. mutator fixation probabilities.
As available beneficial mutations are increased, mutators gain favor in progressively larger population sizes.
Simulations were conducted on WSE using the counter-based genome model, with populations initialized to a 50/50 mix of non- and mutators.
Subpopulations comprised 2,048 agents per PE.
Shaded bands show bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals.
Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:fixheat-wse-altatile:2048} details results in a tabular format.
